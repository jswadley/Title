<div>    </div><div><b>The Three General Wills in Rousseau</b></div><div><b>Jean-Jacques Rousseau treats the general will with a shocking incuriosity. His references to it are scattered and opaque. His constitutional projects for Corsica and Poland together mention the general will only once, and there in passing. He mentions Rome and Sparta three times as often. And yet, inexplicably, he places the general will at the white hot core of his political thought. It should be no surprise that the concept has seen every interpretation two words can bear. </b></div><div><b>The problem is not that Rousseau never offers a definition. The problem is that he offers three. In “Political Economy” it is a transcendent standard of right. In the Social Contract, it is the will of citizens aimed at their common good. Between these—both chronologically and conceptually—comes the suppressed “Geneva Manuscript” of the Social Contract, in which Rousseau advocates an amalgam of both. Each of the three definitions is incompatible with the others, and yet I suggest we treat these contradictions not as defects but as milestones, as they show an unmistakable direction to his Rousseau’s thought. I will argue that this direction reveals how Rousseau arrives at a definitive general will based in personal volition alone. </b></div><div><b>This reading resolves an impasse between the dominant interpretations of the general will: a formal account focused on the procedures of democratic sovereignty, and a substantive account in which those procedures serve a transcendent standard of right. Both approaches are insightful, but both share the same error: too much attention to the general elements of the volonte generale and too little attention to the will. Yet will is everything in Rousseau’s politics; it is both the gift and the giver of law. By studying the competing ways Rousseau defines the general will, it becomes clear that the formal constraints and substantive values are all drawn from a single source: the immanent general will of the citizenry.</b></div><div><b>Making this case requires reconstructing Rousseau’s general will across three of his central texts: “Economic Politique”, the “Geneva Manuscript” of the Social Contract, and the Social Contract itself. The heart of my argument follows an examination of the “Geneva Manuscript” in Part III, where I argue the “Manuscript” shows why Rousseau cannot be a friend to both democratic sovereignty and a transcendent general will. Indeed, the latter would commit him to an intolerable epistocracy. Rousseau gives every indication of seeing this himself when he overhauls the text and abandons transcendence altogether. </b></div><div><b>The paper ends these reflections by asking how this new interpretation of the general will improves on current alternatives. I conclude that the historical, logical, and textual evidence all point us toward a general will that is, in the end, only a will. </b></div><div><b>I. Let us begin with certainties. Rousseau argues that the general will alone is the source of legitimate law. It both constrains and expresses the people’s absolute sovereignty. Formally, the Social Contract requires that the general will be:</b></div><ul><li><div><b>General in its source. Each citizens thinks for himself in voting, and none is &nbsp;excluded from deliberation.</b></div></li><li><div><b>General in its application. Each must equally feel the effect of the laws.</b></div></li><li><div><b>General in its subject. Laws must privilege none, harm none, and benefit all.</b></div></li></ul><div><b>Note that the first and second requirements are compliments: general application requires the rule of law, while generality of source requires law by the ruled. These are propped up by last requirement that the laws themselves be general: the only way to ensure general application and general input is to require that no questions be posed about laws that will benefit any one faction.</b></div><div><b>Beyond these certainties there is little agreement. Formalists argue that these constraints are sufficient for legitimacy: that Rousseau is a positivist, and because only positive law can express the general will, no higher standard of right (such as natural law) is needed. For Leo Strauss, this quality of completeness marks a pivotal moment of modernity. Strauss’s general will is simply a process, devoid of content. It wills what it will and calls it justice; “cannibalism is as just as its opposite.” Most of those influenced by Strauss take a less extreme view. Roger Masters concedes that Rousseau’s metaphysics relies on natural right—on principles independent of positive law—but argues these are “detachable” from his political commitments. Rousseau may believe in a transcendent justice, but “the general will is not that just end properly speaking; rather it is a formal requirement which must be fulfilled by the laws which constitute any legitimate regime.” For formalists, then, the general will is always right because it alone defines rightness.</b></div><div><b>Others, whom we might call substantivists, disagree: formal constraints of generality are necessary but insufficient. The general will is not truly general unless it accords with a set of transcendent norms. Some, such as Jacob Talmon, &nbsp;argue for total transcendence. In his influential midcentury telling the general will is a “mathematical truth or Platonic ideal.” It can be willed like any ideal, but it stands beyond will and beyond time. It exists whether or not anyone actually wills it. A more accommodating substantivist view, found in recent accounts by Christopher Bertram and David Lay Williams, argues that the people’s will is general only when it wills rights values—justice, goodness, equality, liberty, and so on. There must be alignment between collective will and certain transcendent values, for then and only then does it qualify as a general. For Williams this means that the general will “must conform to an eternal idea of justice. Its content cannot be arbitrary.” Bertram likewise suggests there is “a fact of the matter, independent of what anyone happens to think” on whether a proposal is fair or just or in the common good, and that fact decides whether a general will exists. For the substantivists, Rousseau’s claim that the general will is always right means that it tracks right values.</b></div><div><b>We learn something essential from both readings. Formalists rightly direct our attention to the positivist thrust of the social contract. Rousseau never indicates that legitimacy needs resources beyond actual will. He offers no method to check an assembly’s vote against an external standard of right, and if the general will could not exist without such agreement, it’s reasonable to assume Rousseau would say so. Instead, every reference to natural right shows how it is replaced by convention and positive law. </b></div><div><b>The transcendentalists are also right, though, to highlight the bond between the general will and its normative commitments. An unjust general will would certainly be a contradiction in terms. He regularly emphasizes that the general will “tends to the preservation and welfare of the whole and each part” (PE 143), tends to “equality” and to “the public utility” (SC 145; 147). Generality implies justice; justice implies generality. &nbsp;An adequate account of the general will must, therefore, reconcile both of these seemingly incompatible insights.</b></div><div><b>We find hints toward reconciliation when we notice that these interpretations draw their key textual evidence from different texts. The formal account works almost exclusively from the Social Contract, along with &nbsp;its unpublished Geneva draft where we learn that “the law comes before justice, not justice the law.” Williams, on the other hand, reaches back to Rousseau’s “Political Economy” for clear statements of transcendence. There Rousseau claims that the “most general will is also the most just,” and that one “need only be just in order to be sure of following the general will.” One searches in vain for similar comments in his later works. These gaps, and others like them, suggest that the best explanation for the impasse is the simplest: as he wrote, Rousseau changed his mind. </b></div><div><b>When seen alongside the movement of a mind in motion, we find that Rousseau’s definitive statement of the general will relies wholly on the will and discernment of citizens. Both the formal and substantive readings miss the centrality Rousseau gives to the common good. In all his works, Rousseau emphasizes that the common good is the general will’s sole aim and the end for which the state was instituted. He derives these in the Social Contract from the terms of the contract itself: we agree to abide by the general will so long as it protects and promotes our own good. As I show below, this means that both the formal constraints and normative commitments share the same source. Both result from institutions that can drawing citizens toward willing and knowing the good they share. This is the “union of understanding and will” around Rousseau builds all his politics.</b></div><div><b>We are familiar with the volition captured here by the term “will,” but “understanding” requires some extrapolation, as Rousseau says little about this directly. In what follows, I use the term “discernment” to describe the key element of understanding, &nbsp;because the word best describes what I take to be Rousseau’s meaning: the faculty that allows citizens to trace and refine the outlines of a conception of the common good. Indeed, the shifts in Rousseau’s thinking are most easily observed in his differing treatments of discernment. His earlier works invoke it is a process near divination, perceiving the transcendent truths of human morality. By the time of the social contract, all this transcendence drops away, and it is the institutions of politics themselves that help citizens intersubjectively define the common good.</b></div><div><b>I proceed with caution. Because I will draw heavily from an unpublished text—and no writer would have a draft taken for gospel—I treat Rousseau’s published works as definitive, and his unpublished texts as merely suggestive. Their suggestiveness is sufficient, though, to show how his thought progressed. My analysis therefore cuts against some recent scholarship emphasizing how Rousseau’s works cohere. For the first half of the twentieth century, Rousseau was seen as an inconsistent rhetorician or a consistent authoritarian. Often both. Scholars have rightly worked to correct these excesses by recovering Rousseau’s coherence, and in so doing have doubtless been inclined to take him at his word when he says his works form a single system that is paradoxical but not contradictory. No doubt Rousseau’s thought is indeed more coherent than many allowed, but to overlook how that thought developed is to miss the thrill of watching genius unfold.</b></div><div><b>II. Denis Diderot haunts Rousseau’s early work. Rousseau’s “Political Economy,” published in the Encyclopédie edition of 1755 alongside Diderot’s “Natural Right,” agrees with Diderot’s entry on three points: that defensible concepts of right are found only in the general will; that the general will transcends all institutions; &nbsp;that the human race itself wills generally. Beyond this agreement almost nothing is shared. “Political Economy” does not critique Diderot outright—indeed, there Rousseau credits Droit naturele as “the source of this great and luminous principle” of the general will—but it should nevertheless be seen as Rousseau’s first attempt at appropriating and surpassing Diderot’s account with his own.</b></div><div><b>In Diderot the volonté générale never earns its name. It may indeed be general, but a will is seen in the willing, and not once does Diderot show it willed. His earlier name for the same idea—a morale universelle—better captures both its scope and significance. It is an ethical postulate, known through reason, that decides our rights and duties. Diderot shows little interest in its political dimensions. He is main concerned to invoke the general will to explain how rightness derives from man’s sociability. We are social creatures, but we require a standard of right to inform our actions, and in the human race itself Diderot finds a will that promotes the good of all. It is a will that can “enlighten you as to the nature of your thought and desires,” (*****) and is thus less a matter of willing than apprehending. Above all, the general will illuminates.</b></div><div><b>Happily it requires only reflection to be understood, and can be consulted anywhere humans are found. It is everywhere comprehensive and comprehendible. “Where can I consult it?,” Diderot asks: </b></div><div><b>In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations; in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions—indignation and resentment—which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retribution (NR 20).</b></div><div><b>The emphasis on consultation is key. Men relate to this moralle universelle not by directly willing it, but by consulting it and letting that consultation guide their will. The general will exists in the minds of men not as a desire or impulse, but rather as a “pure expression of the understanding, which in the silence of the passions calculates what every individual may demand from his fellow-man, and what his fellow-man has a right to demand of him.” (NR 21) It makes thoughts “good, great, elevated, sublime,” and when it is lost, “comprehension of the notions of goodness, justice, humanity and virtue grow dim.” (NR 20) Morality itself is only known by knowing the will of the race. The great problem of social life is mere ignorance: men naturally desire justice, and only err when they are ignorant of its demands. If they could only be shown the reason inherent to mankind’s universal will, their compliance would be secured. Willing would follow understanding. </b></div><div><b>Rousseau accepts more of Diderot’s conclusions than most commentators have allowed, most importantly Diderot’s view of the general will as a transcendent, objective standard of right. The dispute between the two does not rest here, but rather in Rousseau’s belief that a standard such as these carries no moral weight for men. Human reason and motivation are too poorly wrought to comprehend and be moved by the will of the species. Diderot is too sanguine about our natural faculties. Rousseau’s early general will thus takes on all the functions Diderot gave it—informing our actions, helping us discern right from wrong—even while Rousseau doubts those functions are useful without an intermediary in the law.</b></div><div><b>Before setting out these arguments, though, Rousseau introduces in Political Economy a key conceptual innovation: a countless number of general wills. Diderot had found only one—the general will of mankind—and far from rejecting such an all-encompassing will, Rousseau welcomes it. </b></div><div><b>Since every association has a general will aimed at the common good of its members, it follows for Rousseau that the same should be true for the human association; that in “the great town of the world” the “law of nature is always the general will and the various states and peoples are merely individual members” (PE 143). This global society is made up of smaller societies, which are themselves collections of societies, and so on down through a series of nested associations, each with a will that is general toward members and self-interested toward outsiders. It is the frictions between these wills and associations that “give rise to the most universal and infallible rules by which to judge a good or bad government, and in general the morality of human action.” (PE 143) Universal principles of morality are even closer at hand than Diderot knew. </b></div><div><b>“Political Economy” never suggests, though, that citizens possess general wills. The willing only attaches to the whole. Citizens relate to the general will not by willing it (as Rousseau would later argue) or consulting it (as Diderot had argued), but instead by having their particular wills conform to the general will. What consultation had been to Diderot, conformity is to Rousseau. Alignment is morality’s demand, and twice Rousseau notes that “conformity of the private will to the general” is the very definition of virtue. (***) Government should encourage this where it can and enforce it when it must. The wills of citizens must align with it, and the laws must express it, but in adapting Diderot’s general will Rousseau maintains its thoroughgoing transcendence. </b></div><div><b>“Political Economy” sets out its alternative account of right by identifying the nature of the general will (Part I) and then showing the moral and social contexts it requires (Part II). Epistemic obstacles are the first to overcome. To follow the general will it must first “be known, and above all well distinguished from the private will, starting with one’s own, a distinction that is always extremely difficult to make and on which only the most sublime virtue can shed sufficient light” (PE 144). Knowing the general will—that is, discerning the content of the common good—cannot rely on reason alone. A year earlier in 1754, Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origins of Inequality had argued that reason itself is the first source of human ills, as it “engenders amore-propre,” “turns man back on himself,” “dictates to him maxims directly contrary to those that public reason preaches to the body of society.”</b></div><div><b>Rousseau finds a solution to the epistemic problem in the law. The sheer power of law is what awes Rousseau, who rhapsodizes this “most sublime of human institutions.” (****) It serves the didactic role Diderot gave to the morale universelle, acting as “the celestial voice that tells each citizen the precepts of public reason and teaches him to act according to the maxims of his own judgement, and not be in contradiction with himself.” It is “to law alone that men owe justice and freedom.” (PE 146) The transcendent quality of the general will makes it impossible to know in full. Books of law, on the other hand, can be touched, read, revisited. Law requires no superhuman virtue or reason to be obeyed. So long as it expresses the general will, obedience to the law itself becomes virtue.</b></div><div><b>But of course this only pushes the question back further. For how does the law embody the general will? Would this not require those writing the law—the sovereign—to know the general will prior? Rousseau cannot yet solve this riddle; indeed, in “Political Economy” he gives no sign of seeing it at all. This puzzle becomes crucial in the Social Contract for reasons discussed below, but here Rousseau waves away the problem with a gesture toward natural morality. In one striking passage he asserts that an assembly of citizens, exercising their rights as sovereign, “is all the less necessary because it is not sure its decision would be the expression of the general will.”</b></div><div><b>[I]t is rarely necessary when the government is well intentioned. For the leaders know very well that the general will is always for the side most favorable to the public interest—that is, for the most equitable; so that it is only necessary to be just and one is assured of following the general will. (PE 148)</b></div><div><b>Rousseau slips here between the lawmaking functions of sovereignty and the work of government, but the point is clear: the state needs only a wise lawgiver to ensure its laws embody the general will. Contrary to the Legislator in the Social Contract, here Rousseau has no qualms in letting the leader use both reason and force. The law expresses the general will not because it expresses the people’s vote, but because the general will is always for justice, and the laws in question are written and enforced by those who know justice.</b></div><div><b>Less remarkable than its epistemic function, perhaps, but no less important is the second role Rousseau gives the law: it solves for the weak wills of men. The law lets the state enforce compliance—anticipating later work he writes that law lets men “bind their will by their agreement” and can “subjugate men in order to make them free” (****)—but no sooner does he note this than he turns his gaze elsewhere. For the most durable obedience is found not in consensual obligation, but in love. </b></div><div><b>When we love the fatherland we love its laws, and that love in turn leads us to freely obey them. We abide law as we abide our beloved. Rousseau gives two sources for amore de la patrie. The first is that it provides for us, and its advantages “endear it to us.” Rousseau counsels that these advantages should be made plain: “let the laws be in their sight the &nbsp;only guarantees of the common freedom” (PE 154). The second source is more subtle: the fatherland frees us to be virtuous. Recall that Rousseau has already argued that a private will conforming to the general will is required for the latter to be realized. This confmity he calls virtue, and virtue cannot be legislated. “It is not enough to say to citizens, be good.” Virtue must be incentivized, and love of country and compatriots is “the most effective” means for this because “we willingly want what is wanted by the people we love” (PE 151). This combines “the force of amore-propre with all the beauty of virtue… which, without disfiguring it, makes it the most heroic of passions. (PE 151)”</b></div><div><b>Rousseau’s patriotism here is purely instrumental. Love of the fatherland is needed for virtue, and virtue alone leads us to concern ourselves with the good of others, which is a requirement of the general will. Patriotic fraternity is the the only force stronger than self-interest, the only incentive powerful enough to bend private wills into alignment with the general will. How else will men be led to care for one another? Universal altruism? Without these bonds of love, why consider any interests but their own? Rousseau’s project is not to strip men of their passions—this would make them poor citizens, he writes—but instead to refine those passions and channel them toward the good of all. </b></div><div><b>[T]he government will have difficulty making itself obeyed if it limits itself to obedience. It is good to know how to use men as they are, it is better still to make them what one needs them to be. The most absolute authority is that which penetrates to the inner man and is exerted no less on his will than on his action. Form men, therefore, if you want to command men. If you want the laws to be obeyed, make them beloved, so that for men to do what they should, they need only think they ought to do it. (PE 148)</b></div><div><b>Half a dozen times in “Political Economy” Rousseau stresses the need to form and reform men, and each time he connects this need with the necessity to make laws the object of love. This is not a claim that men will love law only after their natures have been reordered. It is that in fostering the fraternal solidarity required by the general will, men become wholly unrecognizable from those we know from experience. </b></div><div><b>In sum, Rousseau adopts the general will in “Political Economy” in order to stress the origins of law’s power. The general will itself does little work in the account. It transcends the decisions of the people due to their unreliable discernment. Much better to trust the leaders. His few mentions of the will are even more curious. On the one hand, Rousseau says nothing about citizens willing the general will; the emphasis is always on making particular wills conform. Yet when the law “penetrates to the inner man and is exerted no less on his will than on his action,” is this not precisely in order to generalize a private will? Is this not an early claim that citizens themselves must will a general will, by force if necessary? </b></div><div><b>We struggle with these questions because “Political Economy” almost completely ignores the individual. Men feature largely as stumbling blocks to the general will, hindrances to be broken and reassembled. Not by coincidence does the essay feature Rousseau’s strongest use of the metaphor of the body politic; the citizen here is little more than a functional appendage. His identity is completely lost. At birth he must “learn to deserve to live.” (155) The general will alone matters, and other wills must mould to it.</b></div><div><b>The two contributions to the Encyclopédie find the political general will in its adolescence. Rousseau in particular feels confident that the concept holds promise, but he is not yet sure what to do with it. All the aims he ever gives to government are here, but their means are by turns unclear or unsettling. Important though “Political Economy” remains, it is not the sort of essay on which a reputation like Rousseau’s could hang. No, the reason he still enlivens so much of our political thought today is that, even as the ink dried on “Political Economy,” Rousseau was discovering the contract.</b></div><div><b>III. Any discussion of the “Geneva Manuscript” must begin with two facts. The first is that Rousseau gives more attention here to his principles of political right—to the contract, the general will, the common good, and the law—than in any other work. Nowhere else does he cover so much theoretical ground. </b></div><div><b>The second—and more surprising fact—is that nearly all the central points of these arguments are missing from the Social Contract. Many just drop away. Those that remain are transformed. </b></div><div><b>The “Geneva Manuscript” is Rousseau’s most sustained work of political philosophy, and when studied on its own terms, it not only reveals a unique conception of the general will, but suggests why the author felt forced to abandon it on the cusp of its publication.</b></div><div><b>That the manuscript was scrapped is all the more unexpected since Rousseau started the Social Contract quite early. He began work on it shortly after finishing “Political Economy”—most likely in 1756, the following year—which is reflected in the continuity we find in the “Geneva Manuscript.” (Indeed, a crucial passage on the law is copied almost verbatim.) We know little of the manuscript itself. C.E. Vaughan argues Rousseau “manifestly intended for the copy to be sent to the press” since he penned it in his finest hand; no slapdash draft this. He likely presented it to his publisher in 1760, and in 1761 discarded it and then, in a matter of months, entirely recast the argument, one he’d been developing now for the better part of a decade. The finished copy was submitted in late 1761 and published in 1762—the same year as Emile—in a timeline that highlights the pressure under which Rousseau chose to undertake his revisions. At some point unknown to us, the Genevan text was torn in two. Only the first remnant has come down to us, comprising two books and the start of a third; the second part has been lost.</b></div><div><b>Rousseau’s revisions to this early draft of the Social Contract have been of surprisingly little interest to scholars. Most commentary focuses on the first two chapters directed at Diderot, chapters Rousseau would eventually discard. Vaughan’s view in 1915 that beyond these two chapters the differences are “functionally of no great importance” has remained something of a consensus. For much of the 20th century, that consensus held that Rousseau removed these chapters “only because, but about 1760, he must have seen that its style and form made it unsuitable for publication.”</b></div><div><b>Such claims do not withstand scrutiny. There are passages carried through to the Social Contract where Rousseau maintains the argument but overhauls the prose, but most of his revisions don’t take this form. These are largely revisions of content, not style. For not only is the “Geneva Manuscript” pitched at a higher theoretical register than the published version, but the very nature of its theory shifts for publication. Beyond the whole passages removed or rearranged, some of the most telling revisions are small: a word omitted; a phrase softened; a disclaimer removed or added. When one sets the two drafts side by side, one gets the inescapable feeling that the edits move in the same direction: from abstractions to expediencies, from philosophy toward the pragmatics of politics, and from the transcendence of “Political Economy” toward an institutionally derived general will. The politics of the early draft is an unstable amalgam that required more than simply cutting chapters.</b></div><div><b>The instability we find in the text comes from Rousseau’s attempt to reconcile two opposing views of the general will; one transcendent, one immanent. The transcendent will he carries over from “Political Economy,” now on full display in a devastating vivisection of Diderot’s natural law. The opening chapters of the book are entirely transcendent. The immanent will, alternatively, is present only in embryo, but it is the same will that Rousseau would make the centerpiece of the Social Contract. It is in his attempt to fuse these two conceptions that Rousseau creates a volatile third incompatible with either his earlier or later texts.</b></div><div><b>In the Encyclopédie, while the two were still friends, Rousseau’s critique of Diderot had been subtle, framed to offer an alternative, not an altercation. Now Rousseau assails Diderot from every side, to the complete desolation of Diderot’s argument for natural right. Rousseau elaborates along two lines addressed the weaknesses he implicitly noted in “Political Economy”: Diderot gives no reason to think natural men can understand humanity’s general will, and worse, even a cognizable universal general will provides none of the motivations needed to overcome man’s natural moral privation. Rousseau addresses the latter first.</b></div><div><b>Book I opens with a chapter titled “On the General Society of the Human Race” in which Rousseau finds that Diderot (never mentioned by name) has failed to understand natural man’s motivations. To be just in the state of nature is on Rousseau’s account to be exposed. “I fail to see how my moderation could protect me,” says Rousseau in the voice of natural, “independent man.” If he abstains from dominating others, others will dominate him. &nbsp;Force alone is safety. “[I]t will be my business to get the strong on my side, by sharing with them the spoils from the weak. This would be better than justice for my own advantage and for my security” These vulnerabilities, and the conflicts they create, make it so that "an alliance between private interest and the general good... are mutually exclusive in the natural order of things” (GM 79).</b></div><div><b>Here, as in “Political Economy,” Rousseau still accepts the existence of a general will of mankind. His break with Diderot is not yet complete. But now the force of this will is weakened; it has lost its motivational force. We observe this in a culminating passage that gives the text’s first invocation of the general will, and is remarkable not only for its refutation of Diderot (the “philosopher”) using his own words, but for the key concession he makes to his former friend. It merits review it in its entirety, and I have italicized Rousseau’s direct quotations from "Droit Natural."</b></div><div><b>[T]he philosopher will send me back to the human race itself, which alone ought to decide because the greatest good of all is the only passion it has. He will tell me that the individual should address himself to the general will in order to find out to what extent he should be man, Citizen, Subject, Father, child, and when it is suitable for him to live and to die. “I admit that I see in this the rule that I can consult, but I do not yet see,” our independent man will say, “the reason for subjecting myself to this rule. It is not a matter of teaching me what justice is, but of showing me what interest I have in being just.” Indeed, no one will deny the general will in each individual is a pure act of the understanding, which reasons in the silence of the passions about what man can demand of his fellow man and what his fellow man has the right to demand of him…. [But don’t] the preceding objections still exist and doesn’t it still remain to be seen how is personal interest requires his submission to the general will? (GM 79)</b></div><div><b>In restating this motivational dilemma, Rousseau has conceded all of Diderot’s claims about knowing the general will. He admits that it provides a rule for action, reveals justice, and is “a pure act of understanding.” Natural man can know natural right, whatever his motiations. Even brigands can discern.</b></div><div><b>Yet immediately, as if seeing how much he’s conceded, Rousseau qualifies this agreement. Drawing on arguments from the Second Discourse, Rousseau claims that while it may be possible to discern the dictates of natural right, in practice there is only obscurity.</b></div><div><b>[S]ince the art of generalizing ideas… is one of the most difficult and belated exercises of human understanding, will the average man ever be capable of deriving his rules of conduct from this manner of reasoning? And when it would be necessary to consult the general will concerning a particular act, wouldn’t it often happen that a well-intentioned man would make a mistake about the rule or its application, and follow only his inclination while thinking that he is obeying the law? What will he do, then, to avoid error? Will he listen to the inner voice? But it is said this voice is formed only by the habit of judging and feeling within society and according to its laws. It cannot serve, therefore, to establish them. (GM 80)</b></div><div><b>Diderot’s moralle universelle depended on natural, pre-political powers of discernment, on men whose conscience already directed them toward “fair and honest” dealings. Rousseau counters that these powers are social, not natural, so that the existence of general will of mankind is worthless for providing order in the state of nature.</b></div><div><b> </b></div><div><b>Content with his dismissal of Diderot, Rousseau begins his positive work in the third chapter, where he builds a new account of political right grounded entirely in the social contract. Here he introduces the “fundamental problem” this contract solves, but in a form that will be unfamiliar to readers of the published copy.</b></div><div><b>As soon as man’s needs exceed his faculties and the objects of his desire expand and multiply, he must either remain eternally unhappy or seek a new form of being from which he can draw the resources he no longer finds in himself…. Since man cannot engender new forces but merely unite and direct existing ones, he has no other means of self-preservation except to form, by aggregation, a sum of forces that can prevail over the resistance, set them to work by a single movement, make them act conjointly, and direct them toward a single object (GM 82-83).</b></div><div><b>The state is not an original necessity; he had shown this in the Second Discourse. It becomes so only as man’s faculties develop, as acquisitiveness outpaces what he can acquire. These circumstances lead men to replace their “natural freedom”, limited by brawn and cunning alone, with what Rousseau calls “civil freedom,” which is “limited by the general will.” (GM 85) Civil freedom protects any action compatible with the common good. So long as one avoids harming persons, their possessions, and their status as equals, one is at perfect liberty. This, he finds, is the only bargain worth making in the state of nature.</b></div><div><b>This fundamental problem has a solution in the general will, but here we find ourselves at interpretive crossroads. The eternal difficulty in Rousseau interpretation is that everything hangs on how the general will is defined, and in the “Geneva Manuscript” that definition varies by chapter, occasionally by paragraph. He is of two minds. The parts of the manuscript he later excises are like those we’ve just seen from the book’s opening, with a general will that transcends actual institutions and decisions, the general will as a “pure act of understanding.” We find it again in a striking passage removed from Book II in which Rousseau returns to themes of natural right (the spectre of Diderot is obvious) and writes that “law comes before justice and not justice before the law.”</b></div><div><b>Cut these passages (as Rousseau himself did) and one is left with a very different general will. This is the general will known, expressed, and above all willed by a people and directed toward the good they hold in common. Rousseau stresses this by emphasizing its immediacy: it is the people’s will not “of a past time but of the present moment.” (GM 88) “Today’s law should not be an act of yesterday’s general will, but of today’s, and we have engaged ourselves to do not what everyone has willed, but what everyone now wills”. (GM 103) And when it is necessary to test whether the will of government “is really the general will,” this is a question “of which the People is the sole judge.” (GM 102). These remarks would be nonsensical if the general will could stand beyond the expressed will of the people, which was exactly Rousseau’s position earlier in the work and in the whole of “Political Economy.”</b></div><div><b>Close attention to the phrase “what everyone now wills” also betrays a shift in Rousseau’s view toward the individual. Neither Diderot nor Rousseau showed any real interest earlier in personal volition. That was in keeping with the objective, transcendent quality of the general will: the general will exists, willed or not. But now the Geneva Manuscript gestures toward making the general will immanent to citizens, a part of each citizen’s felt and active will. &nbsp;When he writes that “each individual can, as a man, have a private will contrary to or differing from the general will he has a Citizen.” (GM 84), Rousseau sounds new notes that will become a familiar refrain in the Social Contract.</b></div><div><b>These two competing perspectives—transcendent in some passages, immanent in others— would have little bearing on Rousseau’s account were it not for his choice in the “Geneva Manuscript” to make the general will the object of utter submission. The solution to the fundamental problem requires that no quality of man—not even his will—can be withheld.</b></div><div><b>Each of us puts his will, his goods, his force, and his person in common under the direction of the general will, and in a body we all receive each member as an inalienable part of the whole. (GM 83) </b></div><div><b>The nature of this submission depends on both the source and scope of the general will. If it is a transcendent standard of right, then the will to which I submit may bear only the faintest connection to my own will, only in the most abstract sense of willing whatever is best for me. &nbsp;If, however, we read it as the will of a sovereign of whom I am part, the connection with my private volition becomes apparent, as I can see within in it the force of my own will. It is a will I have expressed with compatriots; it bears the marks of my influence, though it is not wholly of my making. Indeed, the differences between the two perspectives is most clearly seen in disagreement: on the transcendent reading, a will may be imposed that I do not recognize as my own; on the immanent reading, at worst I may be subjected to a will I voted against, but nevertheless helped shape.</b></div><div><b>These are the various positions Rousseau takes in the “Geneva Manuscript.” We have two sets of reasons for thinking that when he set out to revise the document, he did so intending to cut away his earlier transcendent model. Let us consider first the theoretical problems it created before examining the textual changes themselves.</b></div><div><b>Observe the problems a transcendent general will creates for the Rousseau’s contract. It makes the contract irrational, since no one would freely bind themselves to a will they do not know and cannot know well. It makes governing impossible due to irreconcilable disagreement on both the content of the general will and which procedures best discern it. (Shall we draw straws? Consult the augurs? Etc.) And it makes governing amount to little more than domination. How else to describe an eternally imposed foreign will? Yet these issues—on their own enough to damn the approach—would not be Rousseau’s deepest concern.</b></div><div><b>Suppose the general will is transcendent. Suppose, as Rousseau says, the chief problem is “knowing how to consult it.” Won’t some citizens know it better than others? Rousseau has already named one such figure: the “almost divine” Lawgiver, an “extraordinary man” of genius and virtue. If one of us is so extraordinary, will there not be others? Will not some citizens outstrip the abilities of the “average man” of whom Rousseau is so skeptical? (Does not the fact he is average imply others above him?) Everything Rousseau has said about discernment in its transcendent mode suggests that a special few can consult the general will better than their peers.</b></div><div><b>It follows that citizens would be required by the general will to alienate sovereignty to the knowing elite. Epistocracy is inevitable. The general will, as we’ve seen, is simply the will to realize the common good. An assembly of all citizens—most of whom are discernment-challenged—will reliably choose poorly. &nbsp;And since the common good requires institutions that best protect and promote it, this would require handing sovereignty to the class of knowers. Recall Rousseau’s reticence in “Political Econony” to assemble citizens when leaders can know the general will on their own. His doubts grow darker in the “Geneva Manuscript” in anticipating the epistocratic outcome, asking if the people can refuse their consent “to someone who is known to be the master and in whom are combined the public confidence and force” (GM 101). The final text omits the question altogether.</b></div><div><b>That omission should not surprise us, since such an alienation of sovereignty would conflict with Rousseau’s democratic commitments. Tellingly, the chapter in the Geneva Manuscript titled “What Sovereignty Consists of and What Makes It Inalienable” is almost unrecognizable in the Social Contract. The earlier draft (despite its title) avoids the problem of alienation almost entirely. The published text seems to intentionally cut off the epistocratic option by noting that the people “can only be represented by itself” since “[p]ower can perfectly well be transferred, but not will” (SC 145). [I]f the people promises simply to obey, it dissolves itself by the by that act; it loses the status of a people. The moment there is a master, there is no longer a Sovereign…” (SC 145). By the time the Social Contract saw publication, the shift from Rousseau’s earliest views had become clear.</b></div><div><b>If these theoretical problems show us why Rousseau abandoned transcendence, his textual changes show us how. He expunges the passages on natural right; he strips the requirement that the totality of one’s being must be put before the general will. He also diminishes the role of remaking men. Over and over in “Political Economy” Rousseau underscores the need to form citizens. The Genevan draft softens this substantially, relying on persuasion more than force:</b></div><div><b>Let us show [natural man] the value of good actions, the punishment of bad ones, and the lovable harmony of justice and happiness in a better constituted order of things. Let us enlighten his reason with new insights, warm his heart with new feelings; and let him learn to enlarge upon his being and his felicity by sharing them with his fellow man…. [H]e will learn to prefer his properly understood interest to his apparent interest; [thus becoming] good, virtuous, sensitive, and finally—to sum it all up—rather than the ferocious Brigand he wished to become, the most solid support of a well-ordered society. (GM 82)</b></div><div><b>Rousseau never abandons this republican concern for education toward virtue: it is the central theme of Emile (the book Rousseau thought his greatest); his political plans for Corsica and Poland reiterate the need to inculcate love of the law and fellow citizens. Rousseau never thinks our current will is correct simply because it is current.</b></div><div><b>But even as the Contract continues this theme of why and how to improve men’s wills, it rejects Rousseau’s earlier, more totalizing ways of doing so. This softening explains why he replaced two whole chapters of the “Manuscript”—so concerned to improve man—with a simple line declaring he would take “men as they are and laws as they can be” (SC 131). It explains why a provocateur like Rousseau would remove a unforgettable claim that the Lawgiver “must in a sense mutilate man’s constitution in order to strengthen it” by replacing “all” man’s forces. (GM 101) And it explains why he deletes the section on law—drawn almost word for word from “Political Economy”—in which the laws of a transcendent general will can appropriate the goods and even the lives of men “without constraining and without consulting them” and “make their consent predominate over their refusal” (GM 99). Add together these changes and a host of smaller revisions, and a sense of the authors intent emerges.</b></div><div><b>When placed between the published works that precede and follow it, the Geneva Manuscript can be seen for the hybrid it is. The role it gives the will of citizens goes far beyond “Political Economy”, but its lingering transcendence makes it incompatible with the argument of the Social Contract. The constant impression one gets in comparing the drafts of Du Contrat Social is an author distancing himself from previous positions. In preparing the final copy, Rousseau now sees the need to ground political right in immanent will alone, and in doing so not only develops his definitive account of citizen agency, but finds moral freedom in the process.</b></div><div><b>IV. The publication of the Social Contract in 1762 gives Rousseau’s last and definitive of the general will. Here it is entirely immanent, entirely derived from the deliberative process of the assembly. Here the general will is voiced, not divined. None of this was inevitable; Rousseau could have just easily returned to the transcendent view he’d adopted in “Political Economy.” But he does not, for now he sees how democratic sovereignty itself creates liberty, and he intends to show how this can be created and preserved. The Social Contract when taken on its own, as I do in this section, makes clear the importance of the immanent will, and how it alone can solve some of Rousseau’s most infamous interpretive puzzles. </b></div><div><b>Book II shows how the general will is ideally derived; Book IV shows how it can err, and how to correct those errors. The third chapter of Book II, “Whether the General Will Can Err,” gives a tightly compressed explanation of how the general will derives from the wills of individuals. He maintains, as he had in “Political Economy,” that although the general will is always right, the deliberations in which it is discovered can be faulty. “The people is never corrupted, but is often fooled.” Now, though, Rousseau makes two advancements: first he gives the “will of all” a technical meaning it previously lacked, and second, he introduces a clumsy mathematical metaphor to show how the general will is discerned. </b></div><div><b>There is often a great difference between the will of all and the general will. The latter considers only the common interest; the former considers private interest, and is only a sum of private wills. But take away from these same wills the pluses and minuses that cancel each other out, and the remaining sum of the differences is the general will. (SC 147)</b></div><div><b>These lines have been subject to various interpretations—John Plamentaz once called them “sheer nonsense”—but nearly all conclude they mean that general will is constituted by individual wills; and not just any personal wills, but the will of individuals directed at the common good. All the procedural constraints on the assembly canvassed in §1—generality of source and application and subject—are designed to pick out, as it were, the general will within each citizen from the flotsam of passionate attachments.</b></div><div><b> </b></div><div><b>Rousseau’s pluses and minuses become clearer in a familiar setting: every commuter wants a well-maintained turnpike, and each wants someone else to pay for it. When I will the former—the well-maintained turnpike—I will generally and particularly all at once. Road maintenance is good for everyone, and since I am someone, it is good for me. The latter, however, is a merely particular will and undermines the common good, since the road will become marginally worse if I free-ride. Add up all the commuters’ wills, then, and you are left with two sets. Since each citizen shares the private will that says “Let everyone else pay,” these cancel each other, since each deliberator knows agreement will not be reached while that term is present. To proceed, the assembly must instead rely on the shared identical will that the turnpike is maintained. Since this is all that remains once the particular wills have been set aside, this—the “remaining sum of the differences”—is the general will.</b></div><div><b>Note what has been accomplished here. Citizens with various and competing wills were brought to agreement on a broad question: should there be turnpike maintenance and who should pay to maintain it? They were not asked specific questions about toll rates or maintenance budgets or who to elect turnpike commissioner. These are matters too particular for the constraint that the assembly consider general matters alone. Such particulars not only open up greater room for rent-seeking among those who know and can game the process, but they also move into realms of near total citizen ignorance. As a commuter I know little or nothing about toll collection technology or the costs of winter upkeep. But I am an expert at the question set before me, which is how the project will affect my well-being and that of those around me.</b></div><div><b>Note too how little public spiritedness is required to reach this outcome. At times Rousseau flirts with the notion that citizens should always will generally; recall in “Political Economy” how he wanted to remake each in the image of virtue. But now Rousseau thinks this is too demanding: certainly citizens must have some modicum of virtue—otherwise he’d abjure all laws from the start—but legitimate government requires only a sufficient amount of virtue, not perfect rightness. </b></div><div><b>The Social Contract uses institutional order to remedy moral disorder. This is Rousseau’s concession to the moral fallibility of man, his keeping the promise to “take men as they are.” The social contract must allow for—indeed, it must use—the divergence of personal and public goods, since it would absurd to think (as implied in the “Geneva Manuscript”) that one could promise to always will the general will. </b></div><div><b>[T]hough it is not impossible for a private will to agree with the general will on a given point, it is impossible, at least, for this agreement to be lasting and unchanging. For the private will tends by its nature toward preferences, and the general will toward equality. It is even more impossible for there to be a guarantee of this agreement even should it always exist. (SC 145)</b></div><div><b>Rousseau now sees that government cannot be built on the assumption—an assumption, he says, more impossible than impossible—that citizens can always will generally. The entire enterprise of politics is needed because private and common interests almost always conflict. In a footnote added before publication, Rousseau observes that “the agreement of all interests is formed in opposition to the interest of each. If there were no different interests, the common interest, which would never encounter any obstacle, would scarcely be felt. Everything would run smoothly by itself and politics would cease to be an art.” (SC 147) A politics of pure virtue would cease to be political.</b></div><div><b>If the general will is always upright, then, it is not by perfect harmony but by tension. The state should be pulled by equal and opposite forces, formed by opposition. Rousseau explains this in Chapter IV of Book II, where he notes that “what generalizes the will is not so much the number of votes as the common interest that unites them” (SC 149). “Common interest” here means the overlap of all opposing wills. (To return to our earlier example, this overlap would be turnpike maintenance.) To say that the general will is always upright is to say that it only wills the common interest. It is held upright for the same reason a ship’s masts stand true when pulled in every direction by the rigging.</b></div><div><b>Why is the general will always right and why do all constantly want the happiness of each, if not because there is no one who does not appropriate each to himself, and does not think of himself as he votes for all? Which proves that equality of right, and the concept of justice it produces, are derived from each man’s preference for himself and consequently from the nature of man[.] (SC 148-149)</b></div><div><b>The assembly aims in its deliberations at nothing but the common good, and discovers it by having each consider their own needs. Rousseau does not expect altruism, nor citizens abstracting away from their situation behind a veil of ignorance. When asked what is “good for each,” the citizen hears “good for me.” This is not a moral failing. Rousseau sees it as a raw fact of human motivation, the reason why justice and interest must be united. It is just as vitally a fact of human understanding, since I can only fully know my own good. I can guess on behalf of others, but it can only be always a guess.</b></div><div><b>The challenge in this oppositional institutional model (far more sophisticated than anything in the mind of Madison) is to ensure that the interests of any one side do not predominate. An assembly that turns toward the good of one man or one faction loses the bracing that kept the general will upright. Equality is lost—some now feel the stakes of the question more dearly than others—and equity “vanishes in the discussion of private matters, for want of a common interest that unites.” Once one sees that one can gain at others’ expense, “the social tie begins to slacken” and the “the general will becomes mute.” (SC 198) It is for this reason Rousseau warns throughout the book about the perils of “partial societies” or factions, and why he can say, while still maintaining that the common good is defined by opposed self-interests, that nothing is “more dangerous than the influence of private interests on public affairs” (SC 173).</b></div><div><b>Book II thus shows how the general will is defined through the process of discerning what is and is not a common interest. The contract relies on citizens reliably discerning the general will through a process set in motion by self-interest. Rousseau’s new model is much more nuanced than his earliest arguments for remaking man’s virtue, for he now thinks suitable constraints are enough for legitimacy in a well-ordered society. The answer to the problem of government—and here we find Rousseau at his most proto-liberal—is better institutions, not better men.</b></div><div><b>And yet because all processes are subject to entropy, Rousseau devotes the opening of Book IV—the longest in the work, and the least studied—to their errors: one volitional, the other epistemic. The volitional error is one of weak wills, seen in selfish voting. The epistemic error occurs when citizens imagine the general will to be something it is not. In the first I know rightly but act wrongly; in the second both knowledge and action are confused. Thankfully, says Rousseau, both have the same solution: change what is asked of the assembly.</b></div><div><b>He asks us to imagine a state close to ruin where “the basest interest brazenly adopts the sacred name of the public good.” Avarice has silenced the general will, which men cannot extinguish but “evade.” In so doing, they “are no more Citizens in offering their opinions than if the State had never existed” (SC 198). The remedy? Clearer institutional constraints.</b></div><div><b>Each person, detaching his interest from the common interest, sees perfectly well that he cannot completely separate himself from it; but his share of the public misfortune seems like nothing to him compared to [his] exclusive good…. The mistake he makes is to change the state of the question and to answer something other than what he is asked. So that rather than saying through his vote it is advantageous to the State, he says it is advantageous to a given man or to a given party for a given motion to pass. Thus the law in of public order in assemblies is not so much to maintain the general will therein as it is to be sure that it is always questioned and that it always answers. (SC 199)</b></div><div><b>Note that discernment is not impaired; each “sees perfectly clearly” his own good in the common good. The source of the error is a particular will that overwhelms the will that’s been generalized. Half a decade before Rousseau would have been more inclined to offer a solution that would improve man’s will directly, but he does not. Instead, he applies the same treatment he gives in the Social Contract to all cases: hold each to his oath to the general will and enforce his choice to be free.</b></div><div><b>The second error is more difficult, as here men do not even know they vote wrongly. Rousseau treats this in the Chapter II of Book IV, where he asks if a man can “be free and forced to conform to wills that are not his own,” can be made to obey laws to which he has not consented? </b></div><div><b>I reply that the question is badly put. The citizen consents to all the laws…. The constant will of all the the members of the State is the general will, which makes them citizens and free. When a law is proposed in the assembly of the People, what they are being asked is not whether they approve or reject the proposal, but whether it does or does not conform to the general will that is theirs. (SC 200)</b></div><div><b>Again Rousseau suggests that the solution is simply to pose the right question. If majority still votes against me,</b></div><div><b>That proves nothing except that I was mistaken, and what I thought to be the general will was not. If my private opinion had prevailed, I would have done something other than what I wanted. It is then that I would not have been free. (SC 201)</b></div><div><b>Rousseau presents here an entirely new model of the democratic mind. My vote has expressed an educated guess. Not a guess about how others will vote, but about how the common good is defined or, put another way, exactly where our common interests overlap. The vote expresses my will, but just as importantly it refines it. I use the assembly’s vote to improve my powers of discernment.</b></div><div><b>This explains a rarely noted line from Book II where Rousseau writes that “there can never be any assurance that a particular will conforms to the general will until it has been subjected to the free votes of the people” (SC 156). In other words I cannot fully trust my will until I hear from others. If I am in the majority, and the majority gives all indications of willing generally, then I have reason to believe I have rightly discerned the common good. If I am outvoted, I should defer to my compatriots, who found I had unwittingly replaced my generalized will with a particular one. I will no doubt be dissatisfied with his result; I lose some satisfaction. But liberty does not consist in satisfaction. It consists in discerning well and willing generally.</b></div><div><b>This is the essence of deliberative discernment. It is in the processes of democratic sovereignty—the assembly, the votes, the deliberation—that we learn the content of the common good, and exercise our freedom by willing that good. Rousseau did not make—could not have made—this claim in his earlier writings, where the general will stood above collective understanding. Discernment in the Social Contract is demands deliberation.</b></div><div><b>Space permits only the most general survey of these points here, but let us close the paper’s reconstructions by briefly noting two implications of the Social Contract as presented here.</b></div><div><b>The first is that shows Rousseau is not as pure a republican as he is often describe. True, virtue is essential, and it’s just as true that Rousseau remains deeply concerned in the Social Contract and after to educate and “denature” man. Yet we miss something essential if we overlook Rousseau’s clear preference for institutional solutions in the well-ordered state. Against his earlier works, the task of the state is no longer to radically remake man, to “mutilate” his being, but rather to let him remake himself through conversation and vote. The emphasis on virtue in Du Contrat Social is front loaded, as it were, discussed in the contexts leading up to the contract and securing sovereignty. Once the state is well-ordered, Rousseau attends exclusively to institutions. Where we find liberal sympathies in Rousseau we find them here, in his preference for virtuous institutions over making men more virtuous. &nbsp;</b></div><div><b>The second implication is simply to note that Rousseau’s discovery of deliberative discernment between the “Geneva Manuscript” and the Social Contract also leads to his discovery of moral freedom. Indeed, its absence in the “Manuscript” is conspicuous; we find hints of it here and there, but it’s clear that Rousseau did not yet understand the connection between the agency of defining and legislating the common good and one’s ability to obey a law one prescribes oneself. The latter requires the former: moral freedom requires right discernment and a right will, and the lesson of Book II and Book IV is that both are found in the exercise of democratic sovereignty alone.</b></div><div><b>V. Having shown Rousseau’s slow progress toward the immanent general will, we are</b></div><div><b>finally in a better positions to observe the gaps in the volitional and transcendent accounts. Let us conclude by exploring these.</b></div><div><b>The procedural constraints placed on how citizens deliberate—who is included, which questions are asked, etc.—are indeed essential to Rousseau’s final account of discernment, as the formalist interpreters would agree. When Rousseau praises popular sovereignty or the rule of law, he does so to show how they establish the social context in which the general will can be realized. And yet that instrumental quality means these constraints means that strict formalists like Strauss and Masters err when they argue that the general will is free of content. The content should now be perfectly clear: it is the common good, and nothing more. And to those who might object that this is simply to swap one undefined concept for another, Rousseau replies that the common good is in turn intersubjectively defined by citizens deliberating in the assembly. The constraints of the common good thus set clear limits defining legitimate and illegitimate law. Since no citizen can be harmed, to return to Strauss’s example, cannibalism could never be just. Since the formal constraints only exist to realize the common good, they are limited by its limits, and must be seen in the context of their end.</b></div><div><b>If the reading offered can accommodate many of the formalist claims, however, it must reject entirely the transcendent interpretation of the Social Contract. Once we see how Rousseau’s claims for transcendence drop out, it’s clear that David Lay Williams’s careful exegesis of “Political Economy” leads him astray with later works. Pace Williams, it cannot be Rousseau’s final view that “an objective or even transcendent conception of justice is part of the core meaning of the general will” (227). The most Rousseau says is that the general will exhibits a tendency toward certain values: the general will “tends to the preservation and welfare of the whole and each part” (PE 143); tends “to equality” and “to the public utility” (SC 145; 147). One finds no statement that the general will is constituted by certain values. We instead find a consistent claim that the general will aims at the good shared among citizens, that it guides the state “according to the end for which it was instituted, which is the common good.” </b></div><div><b>Closer attention to Rousseau’s substantive commitments reveals their source: these derive from the general will, which derives from common interests. Justice, goodness, and the rest are required to maintain the contract, which is rational only if it protects the good of each. These too are completely instrumental in service of the common good. We need not hold the erroneous view that somehow these transcendent values constitute the general will, for this is exactly the view Rousseau once held, and then abandoned.</b></div><div><b>In the Social Contract the transcendent view gets struck on the shoals of Book II. Recall that on Williams’s account, it is justice and the substantive values of the general will that require that it comes from all. Williams writes Rousseau “has substantive values in mind in choosing his formal constraints” (226) and the constraint of coming from all and applying to all make the laws “more likely to reflect the substantive values Rousseau associates with the general will” (223). Rousseau wants justice (among other values), so he picks procedures that deliver justice (among other values).</b></div><div><b>Yet this gets the sequence backward. Rousseau’s view is not that justice necessitates a general will; it is that the general will creates justice, equality, and freedom. On this conceptual relationship the Social Contract is consistent: in the passage cited earlier (which Williams omits) “the concept of justice” is created by the equality that results from the contract, all of which derives from man’s desire that his good should be preserved. It is the general will itself that makes men “citizens and free” (200). Williams is right to note that the Social Contract admits to the existence of natural justice: “All justice comes from God,” Rousseau writes, and there is even “a universal justice emanating from reason alone.” (SC 152) Yet Rousseau quickly follows this by noting how ineffectual these are: when considered “in human terms, the laws of justice are vain among men for want of natural sanction.” The contract alone can “bring justice back to its object.”</b></div><div><b>In sum, close attention to Book II shows how Rousseau sets in motion three operative concepts: the general will, its procedural constraints, and its substantive commitments. Both of the latter, it is now clear, derive from the general will itself. If contracting is rational only when each agrees to be governed by the general will, then the nature of the contract requires formal constraints to ensure the laws are general in source, subject, and application. Similarly, the nature of the contract—and the equality it both creates and needs—are the source of all the substantive values Williams identifies. The general will is not needed because it gives us justice and equality; justice and equality are required because the contract needs them to endure.</b></div><div><b>If the case for the immanent general will is compelling, it offers two revisions to our overall understanding of Rousseau’s political thought. First, it suggests why he felt compelled to include tools to build fraternal solidarity: the legislator, civil religion, small states, festivals and civic rites. These create the conditions in which citizens can engage each other as equals in deliberative settings, knowing their concern for the good of others will be reciprocated. They are required to set the machinery of the contract in motion. Rousseau believed that bonds of fraternity were the only ones strong enough to bring citizens to care enough about each other to also care for the common good. Patriots will be less avaricious when the vote is called. I submit that this sociological assumption is the source of nearly all the wrong-headed positions Rousseau takes across his late political works. It is not obvious that patriotic solidarity is required for citizens to reliably concern themselves with the common good, and we have good evidence that many of the loudest “patriots” are the least concerned with the common welfare. &nbsp;But the analysis offered here shows why Rousseau would stake so much on, say, a civic parade. For if the contract depends on the common good, and the common good depends on fraternity, then that foundation must be secured by all available means. Rousseau may have been wrong, but he was wrong for the right reasons.</b></div><div><b>A second revision of considering the general will in light of Rousseau’s earlier treatments also helps us put the concept in its place. The general will is an essential part of Rousseau’s thought, yes, but it is only a part. It should not be the only concept undergraduates remember from the Social Contract, for there Rousseau notes that while a right will is necessary for the common good to be realized, that will can only be formed through the exercise of discernment, of learning what “rightness” means on the given issue. We must first learn the good of others before we can know the common good, and that requires an understanding developed through deliberation with others. Discernment and generalized volition, the “union of understanding and will,” are jointly necessary for realizing the common good.</b></div><div><b>All this has the effect of demystifying the general will. There is nothing nefarious or mysterious in the Social Contract. There is, in the end, only the common good, discerned by citizens, and willed into enactment. Rousseau saw these connections more clearly than anyone, and in better understanding his account, we ourselves can make some small progress toward a politics the common good.</b></div><div>    </div>
